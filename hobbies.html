        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <h2>Film</h2>
        <p>I love everything about film. For me the movies are a place of both escape, inspiration and exploration. I also admire the level of technical and creative talent that is required to make a great movie. My favorites include Moonlight, Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse, and Pulp Fiction.</p>
        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>I've been a fan of design for most of my life without knowing it! Everything from architecture, to cars, to packaging never ceases to fascinate me. To me, good design is both aesthetically pleasing and functional</p>
        <h2>Personal Finance</h2>
        <p>Since becoming a (somewhat) responsible adult, learning about how to use my money wisely and have it work for me has been one of the most eye opening experiences. My parents didn't really teach me about money so I have to learn for myself through trial and error!</p>
        <h2>Internet Security</h2>
        <p>I'm a proud info security nerd. Password managers, VPNs, anti-virus software, and private email accounts get me excited!</p>
        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>Going along with the last one, I also love technology. It's amazing that technology has made our lives easier. I'm always researching new tech tools that I can use in my personal and professional life.</p>
        <h2>Everything Vintage</h2>
        <p>Despite my love of technology, I also love vintage things. I love to collect physical books, LP records, and Blu Rays.</p>
